# PokeLoot

## Project Description
This project introduces a digitally collectable “PokeLoot” that can be randomly obtained by consuming a digital currency which can be earned by successfully completing a web-based minigame.  PokeLoot can be viewed and sorted as a collection by a user or even traded between users.  Users can make comments related to PokeLoot and view or respond to other users’ comments.  Each user also has a profile that can be viewed by other users.  Users can also see a menagerie of statistics related to PokeLoot collections that can be used to generally infer who has been the most successful completing their collection.
The features in this project are implemented by refactoring a previously created PokeLoot project from a Web API/Angular format into a microservices project, by adding various additional API’s, and enhancing the Angular front-end.  Microservices have been Dockerized and Azure web hosting is utilizing Kerbernetes to deploy each container.  Azure Devops is being used to manage CI/CD and everything is being driven by test driven development.
